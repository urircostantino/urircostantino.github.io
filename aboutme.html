    <h1>About Riley</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Charlestown, Rhode Island where I've lived my whole life. During the weekends, I work at the Matunuck Oyster Bar<br>where I have worked for 2+ years. I enjoy playing video games with friends, both that I know personally and online. I have a large interest in<br> policing and plan to do that as a career after college.</p>
